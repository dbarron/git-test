          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Endocrinology and Metabolism section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>The older diabetic agents, such as insulin, the sulfonylureas, and metformin, have proven long-term glycemic control and cost effectiveness (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_en_q035">Question 35</a>).</li>
          <li>For most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle modifications and metformin therapy are the best initial treatments (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_en_q011">Question 11</a>).</li>
          <li>Cost concerns are a factor in determining which pharmacologic agents for diabetes mellitus are used because the newer insulin preparations (insulin glargine, detemir, aspart, lispro, and glulisine) are far more expensive than regular insulin or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_en_q035">Question 35</a>).</li>
          <li>Repeated or serial measurements of antithyroid antibody titers are not recommended in the management of thyroid disorders in most persons because the degree of a titerâ€™s elevation does not indicate a need for treatment; only an abnormal TSH level does.</li>
          <li>A thyroid scan and radioactive iodine uptake test are not useful in the evaluation of patients with hypothyroidism.</li>
          <li>Ultrasonography is recommended for imaging thyroid nodules, with fine-needle aspiration biopsy reserved for nodules larger than 1 cm in diameter.</li>
          <li>Patients with asymptomatic stable simple goiters can be serially monitored clinically; serial ultrasonography is not recommended for these goiters.</li>
          <li>The best initial test for male hypogonadism is a morning (8 AM) measurement of the total testosterone level; if this level is normal, then hypogonadism is excluded (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_en_q021">Question 21</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_en_q051">Question 51</a>).</li>
          <li>Screening woman for osteoporosis with bone mineral density measurements (using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) should not begin before age 65 years unless the patient has a particularly high risk for osteoporosis (risk factors such as a previous fracture, glucocorticoid use, a family history of hip fracture, current tobacco use, alcoholism, or secondary osteoporosis).</li>
          <li>Do not screen women who are premenopausal for osteoporosis.</li>
          <li>Do not repeat bone mineral density testing before 10 years in patients with normal or low normal values on previous testing.</li>
          <li>No clear benefit of newer bisphosphonate drugs has been demonstrated compared with older agents, which are available in generic form and may be more cost-effective for long-term therapy.</li>
        </ul>
