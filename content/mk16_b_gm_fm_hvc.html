          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the General Internal Medicine section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>The value of the periodic health examination for healthy, asymptomatic adults is debatable and there is no consensus interval.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for the following conditions: carotid artery stenosis, COPD, hereditary hemochromatosis, and peripheral arterial disease.</li>
          <li>According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended in low-risk persons, and the evidence for screening highrisk persons is inconclusive, as is the evidence for screening using nontraditional risk factors, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, homocysteine level, Lp(a) lipoprotein level, ankle-brachial index, carotid intima-media thickness, and coronary artery calcium score.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening for hepatitis C virus infection in the general population.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in men and nonpregnant women.</li>
          <li>Evidence for the benefits of screening mammography is lacking for women age 75 years and older.</li>
          <li>The American Cancer Society does not recommend using MRI for breast cancer screening in average-risk women and finds the evidence regarding breast self-examination to be insufficient.</li>
          <li>Owing to poor specificity, cervical cancer screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing alone is not recommended, although clinicians can consider using HPV DNA testing along with cervical cytology in women age 30 years and older to help guide further investigation and decrease the frequency of testing (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q034">Question 34</a>).</li>
          <li>Owing to limitations of currently available screening tests and unclear benefits of screening, prostate cancer screening remains controversial (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q049">Question 49</a>).</li>
          <li>The American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians both recommend that clinicians have individualized discussions with their patients regarding obtaining prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and support obtaining PSA levels after such discussions in patients 50 years and older who have life expectancies of at least 10 years (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q049">Question 49</a>).</li>
          <li>Palliative care consultation programs are associated with significant hospital cost savings, with an adjusted net savings of $1696 in direct costs for patients discharged alive from the hospital and $4908 net savings for patients dying in the hospital as compared with patients who receive usual care (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q076">Question 76</a>).</li>
          <li>Evidence suggests that more aggressive care at the end of life—whether prolonged hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or performance of procedures—does not improve either quality or duration of life (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q089">Question 89</a>).</li>
          <li>Feeding tubes are not recommended for terminal cancer.</li>
          <li>There is no specific role for diagnostic testing in the assessment and management of chronic noncancer pain because abnormalities that are identified may not be the source of the patient’s pain (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q117">Question 117</a>).</li>
          <li>Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections and acute bronchitis in nonelderly immunocompetent patients is not recommended (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q013">Question 13</a>).</li>
          <li>Patients with chronic fatigue for longer than 1 month rarely have abnormalities on either physical or laboratory evaluation; testing should thus be judicious and performed only when clearly indicated (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q007">Question 7</a>).</li>
          <li>Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome should have regular follow-up to monitor their symptoms, for support and validation, and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic and treatment interventions.</li>
          <li>Tests with the lowest likelihood of affecting diagnosis or management of syncope include head CT scan, carotid Doppler ultrasonography, electroencephalography, and cardiac enzyme levels; these studies may be indicated if symptoms point to specific etiologies but otherwise should be omitted from the work-up (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q086">Question 86</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q156">Question 156</a>).</li>
          <li>Neurocardiogenic and orthostatic syncope both are generally benign in nature and do not require hospitalization (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q086">Question 86</a>).</li>
          <li>Patients with nonspecific low back pain and no symptoms or signs to suggest systemic illness should not routinely receive additional diagnostic testing (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q091">Question 91</a>).</li>
          <li>Mechanical neck pain outside of the setting of acute trauma rarely requires imaging, although plain films can be helpful in patients older than 50 years to exclude malignancy and to assess for osteoarthritic changes (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q037">Question 37</a>).</li>
          <li>A repeat lipid screening interval of 5 years is considered appropriate in low-risk patients, with a shorter interval in those with borderline results and a longer interval in those with consistently normal results.</li>
          <li>Several nontraditional risk factors may be related to cardiovascular outcomes, including levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein, small LDL particles, HDL subspecies, apolipoproteins B and A-1, and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines do not recommend measuring or treating any of these risk factors when managing lipid levels (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q066">Question 66</a>).</li>
          <li>The benefits of statin therapy are generally class specific, and there is no compelling evidence that newer agents are more effective than established statin medications, which may be more cost effective.</li>
          <li>Because the risk of significant liver or muscle damage is very low in patients on statin therapy, routine follow-up testing is not indicated and should be performed based on the development of symptoms or other clinical findings while on therapy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q158">Question 158</a>).</li>
          <li>Cardiovascular primary prevention with statin therapy in older patients (ages 65-80 years) is controversial.</li>
          <li>Because many episodes of erectile dysfunction are transient, an extensive laboratory evaluation is not mandatory at presentation without symptoms or findings suggestive of an underlying systemic disorder or before implementing lifestyle modification or counseling therapy.</li>
          <li>In adult men, asymptomatic hydroceles and varicoceles can usually be diagnosed clinically and generally do not require advanced imaging or treatment.</li>
          <li>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) combine the highest contraceptive efficacy (typical failure rate &lt;1%) with the lowest cost.</li>
          <li>Tests with the lowest likelihood of affecting diagnosis or management of syncope include head CT scan, carotid Doppler ultrasonography, electroencephalography, and cardiac enzyme levels; these studies may be indicated if symptoms point to specific etiologies but otherwise should be omitted from the work-up (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q086">Question 86</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q156">Question 156</a>).</li>
          <li>Neurocardiogenic and orthostatic syncope both are generally benign in nature and do not require hospitalization (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q086">Question 86</a>).</li>

          <li>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) combine the highest contraceptive efficacy (typical failure rate &lt;1%) with the lowest cost.</li>
          <li>Comprehensive preoperative testing has not been shown to be helpful in cataract surgery and is not endorsed by any major specialty society or payor.</li>
          <li>Preoperative pulmonary function testing should be reserved for patients with unexplained dyspnea (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q047">Question 47</a>).</li>
          <li>Laboratory testing for underlying bleeding disorders and anemia should be reserved for patients in whom there is a reasonable probability of an abnormal test and is not required as a routine component of preoperative evaluation (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_gm_q008">Question 8</a>).</li>
          <li>Blood transfusion is reserved for patients with symptomatic anemia, a preoperative hemoglobin concentration below 6 g/dL, postoperative hemoglobin concentration below 7 g/dL, or patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease and hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10 g/dL.</li>
