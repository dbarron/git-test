          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Nephrology section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Kidney ultrasonography is safe, not dependent upon kidney function, noninvasive, and relatively inexpensive and may be used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction, cysts, and mass lesions as well as to assess kidney size and cortical thickness (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q090">Question 90</a>).</li>
          <li>Although home blood pressure monitors are usually not reimbursed by insurers, their relatively low cost (usually less than $100) and reasonable accuracy have made them attractive components to the management of hypertension.</li>
          <li>There is wide variability in the cost of antihypertensive medications; newer and more expensive agents have not been shown to be significantly safer or more effective than many older, well-established medications that are available in generic form.</li>
          <li>Fixed combinations of antihypertensive medications offer less dosing flexibility and are often substantially more expensive than prescribing the component medications independently.</li>
          <li>Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, reduction of dietary sodium intake, aerobic physical activity of at least 30 minutes a day at least three times a week, and a reduction in alcohol consumption, are a relatively costeffective way to reduce high blood pressure (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q006">Question 6</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q102">Question 102</a>).</li>
          <li>Only consider evaluating for secondary causes of hypertension when there is onset at a young age, no family history, no risk factors, rapid onset of significant hypertension, abrupt change in blood pressure in a patient with previously good control, or a concomitant endocrine abnormality (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q043">Question 43</a>, <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q058">Question 58</a>, <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q062">Question 62</a>, <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q091">Question 91</a>, and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q046">Question 046</a>).</li>
          <li>The benefit of ultrafiltration for fluid removal over adequately dosed diuretics is unproved, especially when the risk of the procedure (central line placement) and increased hypotension are considered.</li>
          <li>Rasburicase is considerably more expensive than allopurinol and is therefore used primarily in patients with high risk for tumor lysis syndrome or if excessively high uric acid levels occur in the context of chemotherapy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q003">Question 3</a>).</li>
          <li>Plain abdominal radiography has no role in the acute diagnosis of kidney stones (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q021">Question 21</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q075">Question 75</a>).</li>
          <li>Cinacalcet is currently the only calcimimetic agent available; this agent is very expensive, and its role in patients with chronic kidney disease has not yet been defined (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q042">Question 42</a>).</li>
          <li>There is no role for the routine measurement of erythropoietin levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_np_q105">Question 105</a>).</li>
          <li>Hospice services are infrequently utilized for patients with end-stage kidney disease who choose to avoid or withdraw from dialysis but would be a potential benefit.</li>
