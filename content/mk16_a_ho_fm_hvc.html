          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Hematology and Oncology section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not institute therapy in patients with asymptomatic multiple myeloma.</li>
          <li>Perform an abdominal fat pad aspirate or bone marrow biopsy as a less invasive method for diagnosing AL amyloidosis (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q040">Question 40</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not treat asymptomatic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in the absence of hemolysis.</li>
          <li>Use ferrous sulfate, 325 mg three times daily, as the least expensive preparation for treating iron deficiency (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q061">Question 61</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not add ascorbic acid to facilitate absorption of oral iron salts in the treatment of iron deficiency.</li>
          <li>Do not perform intrinsic factor antibody testing in diagnosing pernicious anemia.</li>
          <li>Treat cobalamin deficiency with oral cobalamin, 1000 to 2000 µg/d orally, instead of parenteral therapy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q028">Question 28</a>).</li>
          <li>To establish a diagnosis of folate deficiency, institute a therapeutic trial of folate after cobalamin deficiency is excluded.</li>
          <li>Do not initiate iron replacement therapy in patients with inflammatory anemia (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q026">Question 26</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not screen for hereditary hemochromatosis in the general population.</li>
          <li>Most patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura do not require a bone marrow biopsy to establish the diagnosis; reserve bone marrow biopsy for patients with atypical findings including anemia or leukopenia (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q023">Question 23</a>).</li>
          <li>In adults with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, reserve therapy for patients with platelet counts lower than 30,000 to 40,000/µL (30-40 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or with bleeding (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q023">Question 23</a>).</li>
          <li>The likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be calculated using the “4T score” prior to diagnostic testing or treatment.</li>
          <li>Do not routinely perform thrombophilia testing in patients with venous thromboembolism; in most instances, the results will not influence treatment duration.</li>
          <li>Use pretest probability models to determine the diagnostic likelihood of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in outpatients; patients with low pretest probability scores and a normal D-dimer assay do not require imaging studies.</li>
          <li>Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) rather than unfractionated heparin should be used whenever possible for the initial inpatient treatment of deep venous thrombosis; unfractionated heparin or LMWH is appropriate for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q029">Question 29</a>).</li>
          <li>Outpatient treatment of deep venous thrombosis, and possibly pulmonary embolism, with low-molecular-weight heparin is safe and cost-effective for carefully selected patients and should be considered if the required support services are in place.</li>
          <li>Preoperative coagulation screening is recommended only in patients with a personal or family history of mucocutaneous or postsurgical bleeding; there is no indication for routine coagulation screening of most surgical patients.</li>
          <li>Hematologic evaluation for anemia in pregnant women is necessary only in patients with marked anemia, additional cytopenias, abnormal reticulocyte counts, or abnormal cellular indices.</li>
          <li>In pregnant women with microcytic anemia and no obvious blood loss, empiric oral iron supplementation is appropriate, and additional evaluation is not necessary.</li>
          <li>There is no benefit to routine erythrocyte transfusion during pregnancy in patients with sickle cell anemia.</li>
          <li>No data support superiority of cesarean or vaginal delivery in pregnant patients with sickle cell anemia.</li>
          <li>Do not use screening blood tests (including tumor markers) and imaging (except for mammography) in the routine follow-up of otherwise asymptomatic patients with a history of treated breast cancer and no specific findings on clinical examination (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q123">Question 123</a>).</li>
          <li>Perform <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> testing only in high-risk patients and only when the results will be likely to change management of the patient or family members (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q083">Question 83</a>).</li>
          <li>Manage patients with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of less than 10 years with observation and palliation if necessary (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q084">Question 84</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not routinely use transrectal ultrasonography to diagnose prostate cancer in a patient with an abnormal prostate-specific antigen value or an abnormal digital rectal examination, because it is associated with a high-false negative rate, and patients with a normal ultrasound will still require a biopsy.</li>
          <li>Testicular cancer staging should include a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, chest CT (if pulmonary symptoms or with abnormal chest radiograph), and serum tumor markers (α-fetoprotein, β-human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels); PET scanning is associated with frequent false-negative results and is not recommended.</li>
          <li>Do not use PET scanning in routine postoperative colorectal cancer surveillance (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q143">Question 143</a>).</li>
          <li>Follow-up imaging is not necessary in low-risk individuals (never-smokers, no history of a first-degree relative with lung cancer or significant radon or asbestos exposure) with incidentally found pulmonary nodules (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q081">Question 81</a>).</li>
          <li>Young, otherwise asymptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and benign clinical features (small mobile lymph nodes, present for a short duration, in the cervical and inguinal regions) only need reassurance and clinical follow up, not additional laboratory or imaging studies.</li>
          <li>To attempt induction of remission of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, use antimicrobial agents and proton pump inhibitors as initial treatment instead of surgery or chemotherapy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q080">Question 80</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not treat asymptomatic patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and good-risk prognostic findings, regardless of the leukocyte count.</li>
          <li>The presence of tumor markers in patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) site is rarely diagnostic, and an undirected initial screening for carcinoembryonic antigen, CA-19-9, CA-15-3, CA-125, and other markers is unwarranted.</li>
          <li>PET scanning has not been shown to improve outcomes in patients with cancer of unknown primary site and is not recommended as part of the standard evaluation.</li>
          <li>Patients with cancer of unknown primary site and disseminated adenocarcinoma have an unfavorable prognosis, regardless of the degree of differentiation, and should not receive aggressive platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.</li>
          <li>Observation alone is an acceptable standard management option for asymptomatic patients with resected melanoma versus routine surveillance imaging studies (CT, MRI, and PET), which have low yield and a fairly high false-positive rate (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_ho_q102">Question 102</a>).</li>
