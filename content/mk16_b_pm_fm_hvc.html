          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Omalizumab is recommended only for patients with severe asthma who have allergies, an elevated IgE level, and persistent symptoms despite optimizing therapy with combination therapy of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting ß2-agonist (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q073">Question 73</a>).</li>
          <li>Smoking cessation is the single most clinically effective and cost-effective way to prevent COPD, slow progression of established disease, and improve survival.</li>
          <li>Spirometry is essential for the diagnosis of COPD, although testing for airflow limitation should not be performed in asymptomatic individuals as a screening intervention (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q081">Question 81</a>).</li>
          <li>Roflumilast is a very expensive medication with significant side effects (diarrhea, weight loss, nausea, headache, anxiety, insomnia, and depression), and it should be reserved for patients with severe disease not adequately controlled on other COPD medications (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q085">Question 85</a>).</li>
          <li>In multiple randomized trials, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation reduced the need for intubation, shortened hospital stays, and decreased mortality in patients with moderate to severe COPD exacerbations (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q061">Question 61</a>).</li>
          <li>In the intensive care unit, daily interruption of sedation and spontaneous breathing trials lead to sooner extubation and lower rate of mechanical ventilation.</li>
          <li>Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be prevented by the routine use of protocols that require elevating the head of the bed by 30 degrees and hastening time to extubation.</li>
          <li>In patients with septic shock, the efficacy of crystalloid or colloid is likely equivalent; however, colloid is far more expensive (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q026">Question 26</a>).</li>
          <li>High-dose corticosteroids are of no benefit in sepsis and have been shown to harm patients in earlier studies; intravenous hydrocortisone is appropriate in septic shock only if blood pressure is poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q026">Question 26</a>).</li>
          <li>The combination of history, physical examination, serology, and characteristic radiographic studies can often lead to a firm diagnosis and obviate the need for an open lung biopsy in up to 60% or more of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease.</li>
          <li>Examination of previous chest imaging is critical in pulmonary nodule evaluation and may show that a nodule is stable, growing, or shrinking over time.</li>
          <li>Solid pulmonary nodules that remain stable in size for 2 years on chest radiograph or CT scan are considered benign, and no further follow-up is indicated; this is known as the 2-year stability rule.</li>
          <li>Calcification in a benign pattern (central, diffuse, lamellar) indicates that a pulmonary nodule is a granuloma and requires no further investigation (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q006">Question 6</a>).</li>
          <li>In order to limit unnecessary invasive testing, the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer is best done simultaneously.</li>
          <li>PET scanning and integrated PET-CT are valuable tools in the evaluation of non–small cell lung cancer; they have been shown to be cost effective owing to avoidance of unnecessary surgery in one out of five patients whose disease was previously considered resectable.</li>
          <li>Thoracentesis is not necessary in patients who develop small pleural effusions associated with heart failure, pneumonia, or heart surgery.</li>
          <li>Chest CT exposes patients to doses of radiation that are forty times higher than chest radiography; therefore, the benefit of CT in clinical evaluation should be weighed against the radiation exposure, especially in younger patients who are more vulnerable to radiation-induced malignancy (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q034">Question 34</a>).</li>
          <li>The use of well-validated scoring systems to generate pretest clinical probability of pulmonary embolism is essential to guide diagnostic test selection (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q079">Question 79</a>, <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q089">Question 89</a>, and <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q094">Question 94</a>).</li>
          <li>In clinically stable patients with a low pretest probability of pulmonary embolism, a normal D-dimer assay effectively excludes pulmonary embolism and eliminates the need for further testing (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_pm_q079">Question 79</a>).</li>
