          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Gastroenterology and Hepatology section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a trial of proton pump inhibitor therapy rather than endoscopy for patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease without alarm symptoms (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q015">Question 15</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q069">Question 69</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not perform repeat endoscopy to confirm ulcer healing for uncomplicated duodenal ulcers unless the patient remains symptomatic despite treatment.</li>
          <li>For patients who have a history or high risk of ulcer disease, use standard-dose proton pump inhibitors as first-line therapy for prophylaxis of NSAID-related ulcers because they are as effective as high-dose proton pump inhibitors (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q043">Question 43</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not routinely perform stool studies (fecal leukocytes, stool culture, ova and parasites, <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxin assay) for patients with acute diarrhea, because the vast majority of patients will have a self-limited viral gastroenteritis that responds to supportive care (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q004">Question 4</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not repeat colonoscopy within 5 years of an index colonoscopy in asymptomatic patients with low-risk adenomas (1 to 2 adenomas, &lt;1 cm, tubular morphology, and low-grade dysplasia).</li>
          <li>Patients with a small number of hyperplastic polyps should be screened according to general population guidelines (every 10 years).</li>
          <li>The best serologic test to screen for celiac disease is the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibody, but the sensitivity (69%-93%) and specificity (96%-100%) vary significantly among laboratories (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q010">Question 10</a>).</li>
          <li>Caution should be used when ordering tests for serologic and genetic markers for diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, because a false-positive result can lead to unnecessary testing and higher insurance premiums, and false negatives can lead to neglect of a proper evaluation.</li>
          <li>Observation, not cholecystectomy, is recommended for adult patients with asymptomatic gallstones (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_gi_q042">Question 42</a>).</li>
        </ul>
