          <h2>Welcome to MKSAP 16 Digital!</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoy using MKSAP 16 Digital, which encompasses MKSAP 16 Online as well as downloadable apps for tablets, desktops, and smartphones, including an app for Board Basics 3. Our goal in creating MKSAP 16 Digital was to accommodate your schedule and learning style by offering you access to MKSAP 16 content when you are at work, home, or traveling, whether you are connected to the Internet or not.</p>

<p>MKSAP 16 is the culmination of 2 years of effort by dozens of leading subspecialists across the United States. MKSAP 16's authoring committees have strived to help internists succeed in Maintenance of Certification and to help residents prepare for the certifying examination. MKSAP 16 also helps you update your medical knowledge with content in 11 subspecialty text sections and elevates standards of self-learning by allowing you to assess your knowledge with 1,200 all-new, statistically validated multiple-choice questions, which are among the best in medicine. To provide you with the freshest perspective possible, our authors, who are demonstrated leaders in internal medicine education, start from the ground up, writing completely new content each edition.</p>
