          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Dermatology section of MKSAP 16.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use white petrolatum to treat hand dermatitis because it is an inexpensive, readily available, and effective moisturizer.</li>
          <li>Use over-the-counter topical antifungal agents (miconazole, clotrimazole, terbinafine) to treat superficial dermatophyte infections that do not involve the scalp, hair follicles, or nails (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_dm_q053">Question 53</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not use serology for the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infections as it is usually not helpful because most adults are seropositive.</li>
          <li>Do not use topical antiviral treatment for herpes simplex virus infections because they are expensive and hasten wound healing only by a small margin; treatment with oral antiviral therapies is recommended when treatment is felt to be necessary.</li>
          <li>Use a simple nonstick dressing over white petrolatum for the treatment of most simple cuts and scrapes and avoid many types of expensive wound dressings that are commercially available (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_dm_q069">Question 69</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not use topical corticosteroids or antihistamines to treat neuropathic itch. Application of cool packs or ice may provide symptomatic relief (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_dm_q044">Question 44</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not use prophylactic systemic antibiotics for patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis because of risks of antibiotic resistance and drug side effects without evidence of clinical benefit (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_dm_q022">Question 22</a>).</li>
          <li>Treat onychomycosis only if it is bothersome or associated with an infectious risk. Oral antifungal therapy is the most effective approach when treatment is indicated (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_dm_q021">Question 21</a>).</li>
        </ul>
