          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Neurology section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not routinely order neuroimaging or other diagnostic tests (electroencephalography, lumbar puncture, or blood testing) in patients with primary headaches; the diagnostic yield of a brain MRI or a head CT scan in patients with a chronic headache and no other concerning signs or symptoms is less than 1% (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_nr_q058">Question 58</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not use the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for secondary prevention of stroke because this combination has no additional benefit over a single antiplatelet agent alone and has a higher risk of bleeding (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_nr_q034">Question 34</a>).</li>
          <li>Order CT of the head rather than MRI of the brain to rule out an intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid bleeding, or hydrocephalus in a patient with an acute stroke because CT is more cost-effective, less time consuming, and more readily available than MRI (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_nr_q007">Question 7</a>).</li>
          <li>Treat neuropathic pain with generic tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) because they are generally better tolerated and much less expensive than pregabalin, although their use may be limited by the development of anticholinergic adverse effects.</li>
          <li>After brain death has been established with apnea testing, do not perform confirmatory testing with electroencephalography or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography because it is unnecessary (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_nr_q008">Question 8</a>).</li>
        </ul>
