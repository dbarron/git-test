          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Infectious Disease section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not use latex agglutination tests to identify the cause of bacterial meningitis because results of these tests rarely change treatment.</li>
          <li>Pre-lumbar puncture CT scans are only recommended in patients with a suspected mass lesion; who are immunocompromised; who have a history of central nervous system disease; or who present with new-onset seizures, decreased level of consciousness, focal neurologic deficits, or papilledema.</li>
          <li>The diagnosis of skin infections is typically based on clinical findings, not blood, skin, or biopsy cultures.</li>
          <li>Incision and drainage is the primary therapy for a cutaneous abscess, and possibly, antibiotic treatment, depending on extent and severity of infection.</li>
          <li>Ulcers that are clinically uninfected (that is, without purulence or inflammation) should not be treated with antibiotics.</li>
          <li>Blood cultures, sputum Gram stain and culture, and pneumococcal and Legionella urine antigen testing are optional in outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q079">Question 79</a>).</li>
          <li>Once patients with pneumonia are ready to switch to oral therapy, most can be safely discharged without observation (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q046">Question 46</a>).</li>
          <li>Follow-up chest imaging is not indicated in most patients with pneumonia who improve with treatment but should be considered in those who are older than 40 years of age and smokers.</li>
          <li>Serologic testing is not recommended for patients with early Lyme disease because a measurable antibody response may not have had time to develop (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q023">Question 23</a>).</li>
          <li>Serologic testing for Lyme disease should be restricted to patients with clinically suggestive signs or symptoms who either reside in or have traveled to an endemic area.</li>
          <li>Urine culture is usually not needed for patients with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection because results rarely change management.</li>
          <li>Urologic investigation, including CT and/or ultrasonography, should be restricted to those with pyelonephritis who have persistent flank pain or fever after 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy.</li>
          <li>Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is indicated only in pregnant women and patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q085">Question 85</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not obtain MRIs to follow treatment response of patients with osteomyelitis because results are not very specific and can lead to additional unwarranted therapy.</li>
          <li>Do obtain blood cultures in patients with suspected vertebral osteomyelitis because such culture results are positive in more than 50% of patients and can minimize the extent of the evaluation.</li>
          <li>Do not obtain stool cultures in otherwise healthy patients with diarrhea unless they have had symptoms for longer than 3 days, associated fever, or bloody or mucoid stools because results rarely change management (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q048">Question 48</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not obtain stool cultures in hospitalized patients with diarrhea after they have been in the hospital longer than 3 days.</li>
          <li>Do not send formed stool for Clostridium difficile toxin testing because positive results are more likely to reflect colonization than active infection.</li>
          <li>Do not send stool for ova and parasites testing in patients with diarrhea lasting fewer than 7 days.</li>
          <li>HIV viral load testing should only be used to diagnose patients with suspected acute-phase HIV and to monitor the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment.</li>
          <li>When influenza virus infection has been documented in the community, a diagnosis can be established clinically and rapid influenza diagnostic tests are unnecessary.</li>
          <li>Prophylactic or therapeutic antiviral therapy should be avoided in persons at low risk for or with equivocal clinical findings of influenza virus infection (see <a class="question" href="mk16_b_id_q043">Question 43</a>).</li>
          <li>Use newer antimicrobial agents only when clearly indicated and when appropriate treatment options are unavailable because they are expensive and need to be reserved for the most serious infections.</li>
