          <h2>High-Value Care Recommendations</h2>
          <p>The American College of Physicians, in collaboration with multiple other organizations, is embarking on a national initiative to promote awareness about the importance of stewardship of health care resources. The goals are to improve health care outcomes by providing care of proven benefit and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary and even harmful interventions. The initiative comprises several programs that integrate the important concept of health care value (balancing clinical benefit with costs and harms) for a given intervention into various educational materials to address the needs of trainees, practicing physicians, and patients.</p>
          <p>To integrate discussion of high-value, cost-conscious care into MKSAP 16, we have created recommendations based on the medical knowledge content that we feel meet the below definition of high-value care and bring us closer to our goal of improving patient outcomes while conserving finite resources.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Value Care Recommendation:</strong> A recommendation to choose diagnostic and management strategies for patients in specific clinical situations that balance clinical benefit with cost and harms with the goal of improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>Below are the High-Value Care Recommendations for the Rheumatology section of MKSAP 16.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not obtain an antinuclear antibody test in patients with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia or in patients with fibromyalgia.</li>
          <li>The diagnosis of periarthritis (bursitis, tendinitis) is based upon the history and physical examination; laboratory testing and imaging are unnecessary (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q059">Question 59</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q076">Question 76</a>).</li>
          <li>Do not perform an MRI in patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome, because the diagnostic utility of MRI in this setting is unclear (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q081">Question 81</a>).</li>
          <li>Methotrexate may be used as the initial disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for rheumatoid arthritis treatment; this agent is usually better tolerated than other DMARDs and also has good efficacy, long-term compliance rates, and a relatively low cost (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q028">Question 28</a> and <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q067">Question 67</a>).</li>
          <li>When sacroiliitis is suspected, begin with plain radiography and only proceed to MRI of the sacroiliac joints in patients with high clinical suspicion and negative plain radiographs (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q041">Question 41</a>).</li>
          <li>Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are monitored clinically; do not use periodic CT or MRI to monitor disease activity and response to treatment.</li>
          <li>Treat patients with podagra (inflammation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint) empirically for gout and do not perform joint aspiration, because gout is common and infection uncommon in this location.</li>
          <li>Do not use uric acidâ€“lowering drugs for gout prophylaxis in patients who have had single or very rare (&lt;2 per year) attacks; these patients can be managed expectantly, because next attacks may be quite delayed.</li>
          <li>Do not treat patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (see <a class="question" href="mk16_a_rm_q052">Question 52</a>).</li>
          <li>A kidney or lung biopsy is unnecessary in patients with a classic presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (also known as Wegener granulomatosis) and positive c-ANCA (antiproteinase-3 antibodies); reserve biopsy for patients with atypical presentations.</li>
        </ul>
